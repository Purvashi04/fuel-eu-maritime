# Fuel EU Maritime Compliance Platform

A full-stack web application built to simulate and manage **FuelEU Maritime** compliance operations — including route-level GHG comparisons, banking and borrowing of surplus credits, and pooling between ships.  

This project follows a **Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters)** architecture for clean separation between core logic, domain models, and infrastructure.

---

## 🚀 Features

- **Route Management:**  
  Upload and view vessel routes, fuel types, and GHG intensities.

- **Compliance Comparison:**  
  Compare GHG intensity across routes against the baseline.

- **Banking & Borrowing:**  
  Bank surplus compliance credits or apply them toward deficits.

- **Pooling:**  
  Create pools of ships to share compliance credits across the fleet.

- **Interactive Dashboard:**  
  React + Tailwind interface with visual charts powered by Recharts.

## 🧩 Architecture Overview

The application is designed using **Clean Architecture / Hexagonal Architecture** principles.  

### **Core (Business Logic)**
- Independent of frameworks or databases.
- Contains all domain models and use cases:
  - `ComputeCB`, `BankSurplus`, `ApplyBanked`, `CreatePool`, etc.

### **Adapters**
- **Inbound (HTTP Controllers):** Express routes for API endpoints.
- **Outbound (Repositories):** PostgreSQL persistence adapters.

### **Frontend**
- Built using **React + TypeScript + Vite**.
- Organized under `src/core` (domain + ports) and `src/adapters` (UI + API).
